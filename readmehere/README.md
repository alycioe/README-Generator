# Professional README Generator
  
## Description
This project uses NodeJS and inquirer to create a professional README file! By filling out the questionnaire, all the appropriate categories of a README file are filled out for a user's convenience!
  
## Installation Instructions
The only installations required are NodeJS, VS code, and the inquirer NPM
  
## Usage
Although this is not a website, to use it properly, use Node to call upon the javascript file in question. In this case, it would look like "node index". Fill out the questions that follow and they will be put into a README.md file under the markdown styling.
